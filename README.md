# Quantified Self

Quantified Self is a wellness application that allows a user to track and monitor calories consumed for every meal. A user has a list of foods, and each food has a name and calorie count. Foods can be added, updated and removed. A user also has a Food Diary, which enables them to manage their meals. Meals consist of 'Breakfast', 'Lunch', 'Dinner', and 'Snacks' - each having an alotted amount of calories. As foods are added and removed from a meal, the total and remaining calorie count for that meal is updated - as is the total and remaining calorie counter across all meals.
